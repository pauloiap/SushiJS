SushiJS
=======

This is the official SushiJS source. If you fork this repository, please **update this README** to explain what your fork does and why it's special.


How it Works
------------

Here's an overview of what this source does:

- Uses the Koko Restaurant API to provide food
- The SushiJS session starts with a toast
- Every client from the API is allowed to repeat more than once
- Every SushiJS piece picked up from the self-service, must be eaten
- Every SushiJS piece must be handled with the correct tools (forks and knifes aren't allowed)
- The SushiJS session ends when all the clients are stuffed and the bill is payed

For more technical details, ask the Repository owner.


Legacy Compatibility

This implementation of SushiJS isn't compatible with legacy tools, like forks, knifes and spoons.
